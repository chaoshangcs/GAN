Usage:
hca cmmd [option]

(m_cmmd) - command, can ben any of 
         kinship, for calculating kinship matrix
         h2r, for estimating heritability
         hca, for performing heritable component analysis
         score, scoring subjects acording to their phenotype and a given heritable component

algorithm(m_alg) - algorithm used either in h2r or hca, can be ML or REML

########### data inputs ##################
data(m_bFilePrefix) - prefix of files in plink binary formate, including bed, fam and bim files. If there is no genotype data needed, only fam file will be adequate

covariate(m_covFile) - file containing data for covariates, each row in this file represent one subject, the first two columns are family id and individual id, data for covariates starts from the third column, each column represents one variable

pheSpec(m_pheSpecFile) - files specifying phenotypes in the given data, one per row, the order should exactly matches how phenotypes are arranged in the data. The first column is the name, which is the only considered for now. 

covSpec(m_covSpecFile) - files specifying covariates in the covariate data, one per row, the order should exactly matches how covariates are arranged in the data. The first column is the name, which is the only considered for now.

kinship(m_kinshipFile) - files containing kinship among studied subjects. One row represents one pair of individuals. Three columns: individual1 id, individual2 id, relation

ksSrc(m_kinshipSrc) - kinship used in the analysis, can be:
	    pedigree - calculated using pedigree
	    SNP - calculated using SNP
	    pregiven - given by user via 'kinship' option
	    

########### for computing kinship using SNPs #############
mafCutOff(m_mafCutOff) - SNPs with maf lower than this number will not be included 

hweCutOff(m_hweCutOff) - SNPs with P-value in the test of HWE lower than this number will not be included

missingProc(m_missingProc) - processing missings, can be:
      del - removing 
      mean - filling out with mean 
     


############# for choosing lambda  ################
lambda(m_lambda) - specifying lambda that will be used

autoLambda(m_autoLambda) - true or false, specifying whether automatically selecting lambda using cross validation or the given lambda via option 'lambda'

cvRepeats(m_cvRepeats) - number of repeats of cross validation for selecting lambda

cvFolds(m_dvFolds) - number of folds into which the data will be splited in the cross validation. Let N be the number of folds, in one experiment, N-1 folds wil be used for training, and the remaining one folds for testing.

lambdaStart(m_lambdaStart) - the starting lambda for testing, the subsequent lambdas will be generated by keeping adding the incremental interval (through option 'lambdaIncr') until reaching the end (through option 'm_lambdaEnd')

lambdaIncr(m_lambdaIncr) - see option 'lambdaStart'

lambdaEnd(m_lambdaEnd) - see option 'lambdaStart'


################# data filtering #####################
incPhe(m_incPhe) - file specifying phenotypes that will be included in the analysis, one per line.
excPhe(m_excPhe) - file specifying phenotypes that will be excluded from the analysis, one per line.

incGen(m_incGen) - file specifying genotypes that will be included in the analysis, one per line
excGen(m_excGen) - file specifying genotypes that will be excluded from the analysis, one per line

incInd(m_incInd) - file specifying individuals that will be included in the analysis, one per line, two columns: family id, individual id
excInd(m_excInd) - file specifying individuals that will be excluded from the analysis, one per line, two columns: family id, individual id

incCov(m_incCov) - file specifying covariates that will be included in the analysis, one per line
excCov(m_excCov) - file specifying covariates that will be excluded from the analysis, one per line


############## heritable component analysis ##################
grCutOff(m_grCutOff) - from removing close related relative from the analysis


############## output #################
outDir(m_outDir) - directory in which results will be saved
